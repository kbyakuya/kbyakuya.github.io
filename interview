    I started my professional career in automobile in Delphi after graduated from Shanghai lnstitute of Technology in 2013.
    I've been in the vehicle management industry for four years, design and test work for five years.

    In Delphi, I was responsible to grow our social media followers and made the conversion rate doubled.
    I got promoted because of the achevements I've made.
    In my current jog at fibocom, I've been designing and managing several electronic module campaigns and I have acheved a 50% of the sales growth with my colleagues in past year.
    It's the highest groth rate among all the brands.
